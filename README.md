# Daisy Seed Template

## Getting Started

Clone the dependencies into a new `libs` folder.
If you're on a Mac, you'll have to grant permissions.

```sh
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

If this is your first time using this template, you'll need to build the libraries.
In VSCode, launch the command palette with Ctrl+P on Windows or âŒ˜+P on macOS.
Run `task build_all`.

Once this is done, you can build code on the Daisy Seed.

Run `Run task build_and_program_dfu`.
